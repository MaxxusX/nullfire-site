i love when people do my job for me, but **DO NOT EDIT THIS REPO.**

if you want to make a change:

1. familiarize yourself with [Astro](https://astro.build) if you haven't already
2. fork this repo
3. make your changes on that fork
4. **_TEST YOUR CHANGES_**
5. sumbit a pull request to this repo
6. send me a dm on discord (`@maxxusx`) and ask me to review your pr.
7. wait _patiently._ contrary to popular belief, i **_do_** have a life.
8. if i think it's a good change, i'll merge it.

if you'd like, you can also leave little messages in your code.<br>
